class Settlement:
    """On the World map, Outlander settlements will have a house icon, Tribal settlements will have a tent and Pirates
    will be a skull and crossbones. Your colony's settlements will be teal (light blue), with the appropriate icon for
    the starting scenario you chose.

    Other factions appear as follows:
        Outlanders (blue for rough, purple for civil)
        Tribals (green for fierce, yellow for gentle, red for savage)
        Pirates (red skull and crossbones)

    Faction settlements tend to be located near roads, and you cannot settle right next to one.
    If you choose a location within 4 tiles of another faction's settlement, the game warns you that this will
    decrease your relations."""
