class Temperature:
    """Each tile has its own averages for temperature based on the biome.
    Only the averages are presented in the world generation menu, but can directly affect your game.
    The effects of temperature vary greatly; extreme heat causes your colonists to develop heat stroke,
    while extreme cold may freeze them so thoroughly, their corpses will never decay.
    Temperature is related to the other three features of a tile in a generated world.
    Naturally, higher elevation and a more northern biome is colder."""
